**registration/login.html**

This template gets passed four template context variables:

``form``
    A Form object representing the login form. See the forms
    documentation for more on Form objects.

``next``
    The URL to redirect to after successful login. This may contain a
    query string, too.

``site``
    The current Site, according to the SITE_ID setting. If you don't
    have the site framework installed, this will be set to an instance
    of RequestSite, which derives the site name and domain from the
    current HttpRequest.

``site_name``
    An alias for site.name. If you don't have the site framework
    installed, this will be set to the value of
    request.META['SERVER_NAME']. For more on sites, see The
    "sites" framework.
