* DirectSeo Social    :SEO-SOCIAL:
** Project Overview 
*tl;dr: Add Social Media integration to DirectSEO to improve UX and
traffic*

Extend social sharing features and implement social alerts so the job
seekers can subscribe to saved searches. Sharing features will be
improved to allow DirectEmployers to capture more useful data about
job shares. Job seekers will be allowed to register on the DirectSeo
platform using their LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook account and
subscribe to alerts for various saved searches. 

** Project Objectives
   1. Give job seekers a way to subscribe to alerts for jobs that match a saved search.
   2. Add more social media integration to DirectSEO.
   3. Increase Traffic to DirectSEO sites (industry average 20-30%)
   4. Improve sharing functions by eliminating AddThis and capturing
      more actionable data on job sharing.
   5. Protect job seeker and employer private information
   6. Build foundation for future My.Jobs portal

** Definitions
*** Follow
Use the word 'follow' instead of subscribe. It's more friendly,
and personal.
*** Organic Talent Community
A group of people that are following a Microsite, Employer or specific
saved search.
*** Sharing
Posting a job, saved search or link from a microsite to a social
network or sending email to a friend
*** Social Messaging
Sending a message to a person you are connected to on a social network.
*** Smocial
Its social. Its mobile. Its Smocial.
** Implementation
*** Base off existing django code
**** Social Authorization                                            :REVIEW:
***** Support login via FaceBook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google Logins :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
***** Support additional social networks/auths: Yahoo, FourSquare  :REQUIREMENT:NICETOHAVE:
***** Collect name and email address from auth provider where possible :REQUIREMENT:NICETOHAVE:
***** Support full OAUTH key exchange to enable app support :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
***** NOTE Authentication should be from a single domain 
1. Logins through job.jobs to avoid multidomain oauth nightmares.
2. Use oauth_callback parameter to redirect users back to original domain.
3. Care will have to be taken to direct user to job.jobs for social
   interaction.
   - Send to friend
   - Social share
**** Follow                                                       :REVIEW:
Provide a way for DirectSEO users to subscribe to a saved search or
page (i.e att-wireless.jobs) and get updates via their registered
social network or email. 
***** Provide a template tag that places a follow button on the page
***** When clicked, the follow button should present options for:
****** How to send the message based on linked social networks + email.
***** All messages should allow:
****** Easy one-click "unfollow" (unsubscription)
****** The reason why the message was sent (you followed this on ______ date)
***** All followed DirectSEO content will be managed in the user's job.jobs profile.
**** Social Sharing Buttons
Many social sites support sharing information (messaging) two ways: 

- "sharing" with your network. Messages appear in your stream and that
  of your friends. Tools like Google's +1 and Facebook's Like fit this model.
- "sending" a personal message to a friend or group of friends.

On most sites, when you click a sharing button, you are only offered
the "sharing" method. For our social sharing buttons, we should
support both models where reasonable to allow people to send a job to
a potential candidate as well as share a job with all of their friends

*****  Requirements for all sharing features           :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** Short URLS using job.jobs URL shortner
****** User can edit message but not job URL.
****** HTML (pretty) Message format for emails.
****** Implement where possible as template tag
****** Log all interactions for future analysis.
***** Support Send to Friend for:
****** Twitter (direct message)                       :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** Facebook (message)                             :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** LinkedIn (InMail)                        :REQUIREMENT:NICETOHAVE:
***** Support sharing as follows:
****** Twitter (status update)                        :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** Facebook (Like)                                :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** LinkedIn (share - stream & groups)             :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** Google+ (+1)                                   :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
****** Email                                          :REQUIREMENT:HARD:
- Users often will send jobs to themselves as well as to friends.
**** URL Shortner
A URL shortner allows us to control the quality of links and make it
easier for users to share links. Our URL Shortner will be used to
embed links in social messages and shares and will provide the
following features:
***** Base96 (job.jobs/eIn39) or custom short urls (job.jobs/l/link/to/somewhere)
***** Permenant redirects for all links.
***** aliasing of existing URLS to measure all shares and unique shares
***** appending parameters to URLS so that source and other tracking code can be injected into the URL.
***** All reasonable data will be normalized and logged for future mining.
***** Will be packaged as a standalone Djanog app for open sourcing :REQUIREMENT:NICETOHAVE:
*** Alerts will be delivered using the user's choice of LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook 
(Long Term: support more social networks and possibly email)
*** Twitter Specific
**** Allow user to choose @message or direct message method (requires user to follow our profile)
*** LinkedIn Specific
**** Need to implement share job with group which allows better targeted social sharing.
*** User Inteface

** Potential Risks
*** 3rd Party API limitations
*** Must resist urge to do too much.
*** Don't be creepy. Make sure we respect end user privacy.

** Potential Ponies
    1. Open source ready Social Alerts app that can be used in other Django projects.
    2. DE Marketing: Growth of followers on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn should add considerable
       ability to generate future traffic to .jobs sites by simply posting/tweeting.
    3. User profile is the beginning of creating the infrastructure to
       implement App.ly
    4. Better *Social Recruiting* demos. Social sharing metrics and
       subscription metrics should play well to prospective members.
    5. Socially enhanced organic tallent communities that let
       microsite owner communicate with the community of people who
       are following a job.
