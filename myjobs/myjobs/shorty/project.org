* Shorty - A URL Shortner
URL Shortners serve five functions:

1. Make it easier to share links in fewer characters. (short URLs or shorties)
   http://arinc.jobs/san-diego-ca/senior-electrical-engineer/19716289/job  becomes http://my.jobs/aU302q

2. Making URLs easier to remember and share person to person. (mnemonic URLs)
   http://arinc.jobs/san-diego-ca/senior-electrical-engineer/19716289/job/ becomes http://my.jobs/arinc/senior-ee

3. Making links have greater SEO value. (SEO URLs)
   http://arinc.jobs/san-diego-ca/senior-electrical-engineer/19716289/job/ becomes http://my.jobs/keyword/keyword/keyword

4. Making it possible to track clicks on third party websites.

5. Making it possible to measure who is placing links.

   e.g. Search on twitter for links containing my.jobs/arinc
