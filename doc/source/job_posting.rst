Job Posting
===========

Overview
========
The new job posting feature allows purchaed microsite owners to create and sell
products individually or in groups. As a My.jobs users, you then have the
ability to purchase these products to post job listings, subject to a
moderator's approval. The only prerequisite to using the job posting feature is
the existence of a site-package, which may be created by a DirectEmployers
staff member.

Product Life Cycle
==================
A product transitions between different states throughout its life time, and
depending on that state may be interacted with in a few different ways,
depending on the user's role. What follows is a complete description of that
life cycle broken down by a user's role.

Purchased Microsite Owner
-------------------------
.. note:: 
    Before a purchased microsite owner may create and sell products, they must
    first hve a site-package to add that product to. Currently, requests for
    site-packages are fielded by DirectEmployers staff.

As a purchased microsite owner, you can create and sell products as well as
moderate the use of those products. 

Product Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note:: Future versions of this feature will deprecate the use of product
          groupings, which should streamline the entire process.
