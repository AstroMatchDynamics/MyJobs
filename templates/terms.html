	<p>Any use of the DirectEmployers Association or (collectively “DE”) websites is subject to the following legal disclaimers and limitations, as well as to DE’s Privacy Policy and other proprietary rights and related policies.</p>

	<p><strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> Those who post material to, provide links to material from, or otherwise make material available by means of DE’s websites (“Contributors”) are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that material. By acting as a Contributor, you represent and warrant that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li style="list-style: disc outside none;">the downloading, copying and use of the materials you make available will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, of any third party;</li>
		<li style="list-style: disc outside none;">you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to such materials, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
		<li style="list-style: disc outside none;">the materials you make available do not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
		<li style="list-style: disc outside none;">the materials you make available are not obscene or libelous, and do not violate the right of privacy or publicity of any third party; and</li>
		<li style="list-style: disc outside none;">you have, in the case of computer code, accurately categorized and described the type and nature of the materials if and when requested by DE to do so.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, DE has the right (though not the obligation) to, in DE’s sole discretion: (a) remove any content that, in DE’s reasonable opinion, violates any DE policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable; or (b) require changes in any license agreement relating to any materials made available by any Contributor.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Responsibility of Website Users. </strong>DE has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, available on or by means of DE’s websites, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating its websites, DE does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there available, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or nonharmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other harmful or destructive content. DE&#8217;s websites may contain content that is offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes and other errors. DE’s websites may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. DE disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by DE&#8217;s visitors of DE’s websites, or from any downloading by those visitors of content available on or by means of DE’s websites.</p>

	<p><strong>Changes.</strong> Content contained on DE’s websites, including these Legal Disclaimers and Limitations, may be changed at the sole discretion of DE and without notice. You are bound by any such updates or changes, and so should periodically review these Legal Disclaimers and Limitations.</p>

	<p><strong>Content Posted on Other Websites.</strong> DE has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which DE&#8217;s websites links, and that link to DE&#8217;s websites. DE does not have any control over those non-DE websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-DE website or webpage, DE does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other harmful or destructive content. DE disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-DE websites and webpages.</p>

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
