You log onto you IPad and see you have a message from your CSM Morning, today is the day we paint Liverpool and Manchester Red. Sixty outlets in about the next seven hours, here&#8217;s the picture of what Great Looks like, let&#8217;s go and make it happen! The first team to hit 500 cases of transfer hours today wins a team night out, let&#8217;s make that the Granada team - I&#8217;ve already booked the table.&#8221;

There&#8217;s no stopping you, a whole section of the bar is devoted to Pimms, fresh fruit from the kitchen in a jug creates a tempting display and a banner along the car park ensures consumers can&#8217;t miss us as they walk in.

You get an instant message on your iPad to say your region is currently in second place for todays incentive. You call your friend and set yourselves a goal of 10 cases each in the next call.

After your successful calls you meet up with your team mates at a venue where the Pimms Brigade are arriving. You talk to consumers about the pitcher offer and hand out a voucher for &#163;1 off their next pitcher on their next visit. What a day!

A day in the life of this role:

This week you have three big focus areas.

Jeremiah Weed Brews are now on all the top poster sites within your territory and you want to make sure all of your top accounts are giving the brand feature and display behind the back bar. To do this, you have meetings planned over 2 days with your top 14 customers, and you are determined to win a fabulous incentive for the top performer. To help, you have also lined up a meeting with a contact from Matthew Clarke, and from Booker, as they both have the brand on promotion.
Your second big focus area is to win pouring status and beat the competition in a small market town where the owner has a nightclub, a bar and also runs the bar at two golf clubs. Winning this customer is worth over &#163;20k of NSV, but it is competitive and you feel really well prepared via your customer and brand insight.
Your third priority is Pimms. Historically, the brand has under- performed in your territory but it is in all the local supermarkets and you know that there is strong consumer demand. You have identified twenty accounts in your territory, and during your pre-arranged call you want to get the managers to agree to run a promotion for the bank holiday.
You have spent lots of time with customers and at close of play on Friday you are able to phone your line manager and tell them you now have 20 outlets signed up for Pimms, you have won your biggest pouring opportunity and that you have just passed on transfer orders for Jeremiah and Pimms to the RTM team.

* Drive down the costs to deliver transactional HR activities;

* Ensure we have robust and compliant HR processes in all markets and that can be easily scaled for growth;

To ensure the highest level of customer interaction, and ownership for delivery of your retail sales value target, all calls this week are focused on delivering the greatest opportunity: availability of core brands ahead of a key trading period. Excellent execution and incremental visibility for the new Baileys bottle launch will drive your incremental retails sales value target.

Throughout the week you liaise with all the fascia champs and other members of the team to ensure clear understanding of each fascia. You are clear on the return delivered from your calls and what areas add the most value in each call.

Historically Baileys has under-performed at Easter but the new bottle can drive incremental RSV and interest in the brand, especially at this time of year with Easter and Mother&#8217;s Day. To drive this and make a real impact on your territory you have arranged a meeting with a key fascia trade driver and through liaising with the regional BDE you are fully prepared to meet the customer needs and the brand requirements through a fantastic proposal across your region to increase visibility and day one execution through a regional incentive. You have identified twenty accounts in your territory with an opportunity to drive incremental &#163;30k RSV.

Your calls are focused on strong, followed up with great execution of planned activities in each store. You deliver value for customers and Test Company in every call and can clearly calculate the additional value your calls have delivered.

At close of play on Friday you phone your manager, and tell them you have achieved an incremental &#163;48k RSV. This is a great result and drive from excellent planning, clear priorities and objectives for each call, use of data driven selling arguments to support objectives and the level of customer interaction and ownership of tangible retail sales value.</description></job><job><company>Test Company</company><onet_code version="14">15-1061.00</onet_code><uid>35384120</uid><link>http://fakelink.com/98C20D74668AF0FB397A4D9C93900010</link><title>Database Co-ordinator - Intern</title><date_modified>3/26/2020 9:38:36 AM</date_modified><hitkey>2044554</hitkey><reqid /><date_created>3/18/2020 8:57:13 PM</date_created><original>USA-</original><country_short>USA</country_short><country>United States</country><state_short /><state /><city /><zip /><description>External Job Title Database Co-ordinator - Intern

THERE&#8217;S ONLY ONE CAPTAIN.

AND YOU GOTTA EARN THE RIGHT TO STAND BY HIS SIDE.



You may know the character on that bottle ofCaptain Morgan Rumby name. But to really know the legendary man behind the brand is to know our reason for being. Henry Morgan was the Governor of Jamaica back in 1682. It was his love of life and sense of unscripted adventure that attracted the most hell-bent loyal crewmembers, and which created his biggest legacy of all.  

He was the first rock star. A man who rewrote the rules of success and knew how to lead &#8212; and win. And now, we are in search of an equally adventurous leader andGlobal Brand Directorwho has the same vision and leadership that begets the legend of the man himself. This person would be in charge of the Global Brand Team&#8217;s responsibilities toprovide strategic and creative direction for a double-digit growth brand that now ships 10M cases globally and help stay on course to become the #1 Spirits brand in the Rum category. And as any Captain knows, there&#8217;s more success where that comes from. The person who stands on the helm of this global brandhas the ambition to drive Captain Morgan to &#163;1 billion Net Sales Value by 2020 by expanding territories and growth opportunities inWestern Europe and Russia/Eastern Europe, as well as expanding our Asian Pacific presence and creating a broad and robust African business.

Does that sound like a task you could heave onto your shoulders and charge forward to make the likes of Henry Morgan proud? Good. Intestinal fortitude will carry you so far, but proven marketing judgment andstrategic penetration at the highest level of business will be your key to new opportunities. Because every Captain has a north star to success. You must be able to lead a global team and ensure markets implement their annual plans brilliantly. Because that&#8217;s what Captains do: They lead. You will need to influence a range of very senior stakeholders, as well as simplify issues and be on the front lines of global brand growth, helpingbuild an effective partnership with the critical US market (70% of global sales) and senior relationships with key In Market Companies (atGeneral Manager &amp; Marketing Director levels). Most of all, you will motivate: Your shipmates. Your sales force. Your global agencies of record, Anomaly and Landor &#8212; to go beyond expectations and deliver award-winning results. This is the adventure before you.

This is a Test Company flagship brand that you will commandeer to continued global growth. Stand on the shoulders of Captain Henry Morgan, and whose legacy is still being written to this day. We&#8217;d love to meet you.</description></job><job><company>Test Company</company><onet_code version="14">13-2051.00</onet_code><uid>35076767</uid><link>http://fakelink.com/B292F1944A7B1EAFF9AE8A6202000010</link><title>Financial Controlling Analyst Trade Investment (Germany and Austria)</title><date_modified>3/26/2020 9:38:38 AM</date_modified><hitkey>2036567</hitkey><reqid /><date_created>3/5/2020 10:31:02 AM</date_created><original>HUN-Budapest</original><country_short>HUN</country_short><country>Hungary</country><state_short /><state /><city>Budapest</city><zip /><description>External Job Title Financial Controlling Analyst Trade Investment (Germany and Austria)
